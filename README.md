# Exploratory-data-analysis
This code reads in two parquet files, one for the train data and the other for the test data. The train data is then randomly sampled to get positive and negative data samples. Positive samples are the instances where TARGET DRUG was prescribed to the patient, while negative samples are the instances where a non-target drug was prescribed to the patient. These samples are then combined to form the total train data.

Next, the train data is cleaned and preprocessed to create features. Specifically, the data is sorted by Patient-Uid and Date, and then we calculate the time difference (in days) between each consecutive visit for each patient. This information is then used to calculate the average number of days between consecutive visits for each patient. Additionally, we calculate the number of times that TARGET DRUG was prescribed to each patient. Lastly, we calculate the total number of visits made by each patient.

Finally, we use the above features to train a model to predict the target drug prescription for each patient in the test data. We repeat the same preprocessing steps for the test data as we did for the train data. We then merge the features we calculated for the train data with the corresponding features for the test data. We use a logistic regression model to predict the target drug prescription. The result of the prediction is saved in a CSV file.
